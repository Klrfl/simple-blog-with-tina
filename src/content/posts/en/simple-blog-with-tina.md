Simple blog with Tina is a starter project for an Astro + Tina site. This starter template implements basic collections, as well as the global config collection, and visual editing.

## Tina + Astro = ❤️

In this starter, I added Tina CMS and set up the already existing post collection, and also global site config which comprises of various site metadata like title, description and footer site links.

Check out this video of me showcasing live editing in Tina!
